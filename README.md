## Installation
The code requires Python versions 3.0 and above, along with the following libraries:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-Learn
- NLTK
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- XGBoost

The latest versions of these libraries can be installed using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk matplotlib seaborn xgboost
```
Project Motivation
------------------

For this project, I was interested in exploring:

1.  What technological themes dominate NASA's project portfolio?
2.  How have these themes evolved over time?
3.  Can we predict future technological trends at NASA using data from past projects?

File Descriptions
-----------------

-   `data/`: Folder containing datasets used in the analysis.
-   `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with the detailed analysis.
-   `scripts/`: Python scripts for cleaning data and performing model training.
-   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
-   `requirements.txt`: A text file listing the project's dependencies.
